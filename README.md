# Unit 17 Nosql Homework: Workout Tracker

For this assignment, you'll create a workout tracker. You have already been provided with the front end code in the `Develop` folder. This assignment will require you to create Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Business Context

A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.

## Acceptance Criteria

When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

The user should be able to:

  * Add exercises to a previous workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises on the `stats` page.

To deploy an application with a MongoDB database to Heroku, you'll need to set up a MongoDB Atlas account and connect a database from there to your application. Be sure to use the following guides for support:

  * [Set Up MongoDB Atlas](../04-Supplemental/MongoAtlas-Setup.md)

  * [Deploy with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas](../04-Supplemental/MongoAtlas-Deploy.md)

## My app

* in my work, the user will be shown a index.html asking them to create a new workout, or to complete a workoutsession. The user will enter data which will be depoloyed and saved in MongoDb atlas. The user will be able to track previous work outs as well as see a dashboard of different charts/graphs of their workout progress. When deploying to Mongodbatlas, I ran into multiple errors that had me at times hopeless. Luckily, my tutor kris was able to help me wrap my head around the issues and was able to overcome those issues.
